It's an applet for Logitech's G15 Keyboard.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Event notifications
- Event log
- Contactlist
- Chatsessions on the LCD ( you can even reply without leaving the program/game you're in)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1)	Stop miranda if it is currently running
2)	Copy the included mirandag15.dll to the plugins\ directory of your Miranda-IM installation.
	If you want to use IRC with this applet, you have to copy the included irc.dll, too.
3)	The plugin should be working on the next startup.
	You can configure it in mirandas options under "MirandaG15".
	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Troubleshooting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting with v0.1.1.7 you will need the logitech drivers v1.03 or newer and miranda 0.6.x!

If you use tabsrmm make sure you have "enable third party event API" enabled for some features of this plugin
to work correctly.

If the plugin is not detected by miranda make sure you have the latest VC++ runtime from Microsoft installed.

(you will need the x86 version, as there is no x64 version of miranda)
