--------------------
TrillianG15 is a plugin for Trillian
It's an applet for Logitech's G15 Keyboard.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Event notifications
- Event log
- Contactlist
- Chatsessions on the LCD ( you can even reply without leaving the program/game you're in)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2)	Copy the included trilliang15.dll to the plugins\ directory of your Trillian Pro installation.
3)	Enable the plugin in trillians preferences - this is where you can configure it, too
	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Troubleshooting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently the plugin doesnt detect group changes or new metacontacts. You have to manually tell it to rebuild the
contactlist in the preferences. This is because the needed events are only available to the contacts protocols.
As long as the API doesn't change I can't do anything about this.

If the plugin is not detected by Trillian make sure you have the latest VC++ runtime from Microsoft installed.
You can get it here:

(you will need the x86 version, as there is no x64 version of Trillian)
